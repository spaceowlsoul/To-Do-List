# :date: To-Do-List

In our rapidly changing world, it's becoming increasingly difficult to manage all the tasks that fall on a one's shoulders.

Business projects, personal plans, appointments, meetings, birthdays, shopping lists...

Everything needs to be remembered so that you don't miss a thing!

It's quite a task if you have no tools to give you a hand.

This program is one of them üòâ

## How to use it?

Download and run the 'todolist.py' file. 
The 'todo' database will be created automatically along with the 'task' table in it.

You'll see the main menu with all available program functions, such as:

- today's tasks: get a list of all the tasks with a deadline for today;
- week's tasks: observe all the tasks for the next 7 days;
- all tasks: clue is in the title! Select this option to obtain all the tasks you put in the list;
- missed tasks: examine all the tasks you didn't manage to deal with in time;
- add a task: add a new one to the existing list;
- delete a task: remove a task when it's completed or no longer relevant;
- exit: exit the program.

See? With the help of this tool, management is just a piece of cake! üç∞
